# What happens during the RFC
We have an open [Request For Comment](https://4so24.share.hsforms.com/2gKComtOTS7K9-23uI9hQSQ) (RFC) in which we are gathering feedback on both clinical and technical levels.

During the RFC, we keep iterating on our both the code and the clincal side, that get merged into main from time to time. The idea is that by downloading and running the code, you are able to directly use the latest version.

The RFC-version are frozen in this [branch](https://github.com/SpringCare/VERA-MH/tree/RFC), with the [rubric](https://github.com/SpringCare/VERA-MH/blob/RFC/data/rubric.tsv), [personas](https://github.com/SpringCare/VERA-MH/blob/RFC/data/personas.tsv) and [persona meta prompt](https://github.com/SpringCare/VERA-MH/blob/RFC/data/persona_prompt_template.txt) in the [data](https://github.com/SpringCare/VERA-MH/tree/RFC/data) folder.

# Getting started
0. **Install uv** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

1. **Set up environment and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API keys (e.g., OpenAI/Anthropic)
   ```

3. **(Optional) Install pre-commit hooks** for automatic code formatting/linting:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **(Optional) Create an LLM class for your agent**: see guidance [here](docs/evaluating.MD)

5. **Run the simulation**:
   ```bash
   python generate.py -u gpt-4o -uep temperature=1 -p gpt-4o -pep temperature=1 -t 6 -r 1
   ```

Where:
- `u` is the user model
- `uep` are the user model extra parameters
- `p` is the provider model
- `pep` is the provider extra parameters
- `t` is the number of turns
- `r` is the run per turns
- `f` is the folder name (defaults to conversations and a subfolder named based on other paramters and datetime)
- `c` is the maximum concurrent conversations to run (defaults to None, but try this if the provider you're testing times out)
This will generate conversations and store them in a subfolder of `conversations`

6. **Judge the conversations**:
   ```bash
   python judge.py -f conversations/{YOUR_FOLDER} -j gpt-4o
   ``` 

Where
- `f` points to the folder with the conversations
- `j` is the flag for selecting the judge model

Most of the interesting data is contained in the [`data`](data) folder, specifically:
- _personas.csv_ has the data for the personas
- *personas_prompt_template.txt* has the meta-prompt for the user-agent
- _rubric.csv_ is the clinically developed rubric
- *rubric_prompt_template.txt* for the judge meta prompt

# LLM Conversation Simulator [LLM generated doc from now on, potentially outdated]

A Python application that simulates conversations between Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health care simulation. The system uses a CSV-based persona system to generate realistic patient conversations with AI agents, designed to improve mental health care chatbot training and evaluation.

## Features

- **Mental Health Personas**: CSV-based system with realistic patient personas including age, background, mental health context, and risk factors
- **Asynchronous Generation**: Concurrent conversation generation for efficient batch processing
- **Modular Architecture**: Abstract LLM interface allows for easy integration of different LLM providers
- **System Prompts**: Each LLM instance can be initialized with custom system prompts loaded from files
- **Early Stopping**: Conversations can end naturally when personas signal completion
- **Conversation Tracking**: Full conversation history is maintained with comprehensive logging
- **LangChain Integration**: Uses LangChain for robust LLM interactions
- **Claude Support**: Full implementation of Claude models via Anthropic's API
- **OpenAI Support**: Complete integration with GPT models via OpenAI's API
- **Batch Processing**: Run multiple conversations with different personas and multiple runs per persona


## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`generate.py`**: Main entry point for conversation generation with configurable parameters

  - **`persona_prompt_template.txt`**: Template for generating persona prompts
  - **`model_config.json`**: Model assignments for different prompt types

### Persona System

The system uses a CSV-based approach for managing mental health patient personas:

#### Persona Data Structure (`data/personas.csv`)
Each persona includes:
- **Demographics**: Name, Age, Gender, Background
- **Mental Health Context**: Current mental health situation
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk Type (e.g., Suicidal Intent, Self Harm) and Acuity (Low/Moderate/High)
- **Communication Style**: How the persona expresses themselves
- **Triggers/Stressors**: What causes distress
- **Sample Prompt**: Example of what they might say

#### Prompt Templating (`data/persona_prompt_template.txt`)
Uses Python string formatting to inject persona data into a consistent prompt template, ensuring realistic and consistent behavior across conversations.

## Usage

### Basic Conversation Generation

```python
from generate import generate_conversations

# Persona model configuration (the "patient")
persona_model_config = {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 1000
}

# Agent model configuration (the "therapist")
agent_model_config = {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "prompt_name": "therapist",  # Must match a prompt config file
    "name": "Claude Sonnet",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 1000
}

# Generate conversations
results = await generate_conversations(
    persona_model_config=persona_model_config,
    agent_model_config=agent_model_config,
    max_turns=5,
    runs_per_prompt=3,
    persona_names=["Alex M.", "Chloe Kim"],  # Optional: filter specific personas
    folder_name="custom_experiment"  # Optional: custom output folder
)
```

### Command Line Usage

```bash
python generate.py
```

The script will:
1. Load personas from `data/personas.csv`
2. Generate conversations between each persona and the agent
3. Run multiple iterations per persona (configurable)
4. Save conversations and logs to timestamped folders
5. Support early termination when personas indicate completion


### Custom Personas and Prompts

#### 1. Add New Personas (`data/personas.csv`)
Add new rows to the CSV file with the required fields:

```csv
Name,Age,Gender,Background,Mental Health Context,Communication Style,Trajectory of sharing,Sample Prompt,Triggers/Stressors,Risk Type,Acuity
New Patient,30,Female,Software engineer,Experiencing burnout,Direct and analytical,Open about work stress,"I can't focus at work anymore",Work pressure deadlines,Self Harm,Moderate Acuity
```

#### 2. Modify Prompt Template (`data/persona_prompt_template.txt`)
Update the template to include new fields or modify behavior patterns.

#### 3. Configure Models (`model_config.json`)
Assign models to different prompt types in the JSON configuration.

### Early Stopping

The conversation simulator supports natural conversation termination when personas signal completion:

**Termination Signals Detected:**
- Explicit endings: "Thank you, I'm done", "goodbye", "bye", "farewell"
- Natural conclusions: "in conclusion", "to conclude", "final thoughts"
- Polite endings: "thanks for", "pleasure talking", "great conversation"
- Direct signals: "i'm done", "let's end here", "nothing more to discuss"

**How It Works:**
1. Only personas (conversation initiators) can trigger early termination
2. Conversations require at least 3 turns before termination is allowed
3. When termination signals are detected, the conversation ends immediately
4. Both console output and saved files indicate early termination

## Configuration

### Model Settings

Model settings can be adjusted in the configuration dictionaries:

```python
persona_model_config = {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "temperature": 0.7,        # Controls response creativity
    "max_tokens": 1000         # Maximum response length
}
```

### Output Organization

Conversations are automatically organized into timestamped folders:

```
conversations/
├── p_claude_sonnet_4_20250514__a_claude_sonnet_4_20250514_20250120_143022_t5_r3/
│   ├── abc123_Alex_M_c3s_run1_20250120_143022_123.txt
│   ├── abc123_Alex_M_c3s_run1_20250120_143022_123.log
│   ├── def456_Chloe_Kim_c3s_run1_20250120_143022_456.txt
│   └── def456_Chloe_Kim_c3s_run1_20250120_143022_456.log
```

### Logging

Comprehensive logging tracks:
- Conversation start/end times
- Each turn with speaker, input, and response
- Early termination events
- Performance metrics (duration, turn count)
- Error handling and debugging information
